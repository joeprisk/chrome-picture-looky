A simple chrome app to search images

This is written because I was bored it is not a serious project but a simple play with anglarjs and building a chrome extension without much real use. you can however use this to search kittens on flickr very easily!

To install this first load bower components

```python
   bower install
```

open chrome extensions and enable developer mode

```python
   chrome://extensions
```

click load unpacked extensions navigate to the folder app

To develop do what you want hack away and break/fix whatever you please

to test load npm modues

```python
   npm install
   ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start test/unitTest.js
```
